Refund Policy

We accept returns within 7 days of purchase. All returned items must be in original condition, unused, and in their original packaging, including all accessories, documentation, and components.

To request a return, please contact support@example.com with your order ID, the reason for the return, and any relevant photos (if applicable). Our support team will review your request and provide return instructions. 

Once the returned item is received, it will be inspected by our quality team. If approved, your refund will be processed within 5–7 business days. Refunds are issued to the original payment method only. Depending on your bank or payment provider, it may take additional time for the refund to appear on your statement.

Please note:

Shipping fees are non-refundable, except in cases where the return is due to an error on our part.

Items damaged due to misuse, improper handling, or modifications may not be eligible for a refund.

For digital products or services, refunds may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
